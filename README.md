# Lag BaOmer PM2.5 Analysis 

A data-driven study evaluating the impact of bonfire restrictions on **PM2.5 air pollution levels** in Israel during **Lag BaOmer** (2021â€“2025).  
This project is aimed at environmental researchers, public health policymakers, and data science students interested in real-world applications of statistical learning.

By combining public air quality data with non-parametric statistical analysis, the study explores whether regulatory bans on bonfiresâ€”particularly the **2025 national ban**â€”led to measurable improvements in urban air quality.

## Features

- **Air Quality Analysis** using real-world PM2.5 data from 11 urban stations across Israel.
- **Statistical Testing** with Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Friedman test, and Bootstrap resampling (10,000 iterations).
- **Year-by-Year Comparisons** of pollution levels from 2021 to 2025.
- Visualizations including boxplots, PM2.5 trends, and bootstrap distributions.
- Reproducible code written in Python for academic and public policy use.
